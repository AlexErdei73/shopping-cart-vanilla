              <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
              <p>
                To excel in this subject, you should have a solid understanding
                of secondary school-level physics and mathematics. Proficiency
                in calculus, both single and multivariable functions, is
                essential before embarking on your studies with these books.
                Additionally, it is highly beneficial to supplement your
                learning with online resources such as

                  Walter Lewin's lectures

              <h2>Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences</h2>
              <p>
                This classic textbook presents complex mathematical concepts in
                the most accessible manner possible. It offers a plethora of
                problems designed to equip you with the mathematical skills
                required for undergraduate-level physics studies. It is
                imperative that you diligently work through these problems to
                fully grasp the material. Remember, there are no shortcuts, even
                if you find the amount of practice overwhelming. This
                foundational math knowledge is indispensable for tackling the
                remainder of your physics coursework.

              <h2>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</h2>
              <p>
                This is a beautifully written book, which is very entertaining
                to read. This book is far from pop science, although it's as
                friendly as possible when it comes to the math. Feynman uses the
                bare minimum math required to explain whatever he wants to
                convey about physics, and he has a lot to share. The book is
                replete with Feynman's unique way of explaining things, so you
                won't always encounter the typical explanations. Feynman's
                approach makes even challenging topics appear simple and
                understandable. However, it's important not to be misled. Don't
                think that this book will make you into a person like Feynman,
                even if you have the aptitude for it. The book merely shows you
                how Feynman was able to grasp physics after much contemplation.
                He must have solved numerous problems, many more than are
                included in this book. This book is one that you will cherish
                and find entertaining rather than purely instructive. This
                entertainment factor is the best motivation you can receive. You
                will need every ounce of that motivation when you delve into the
                rest of the books, as those will serve as your true teachers.
