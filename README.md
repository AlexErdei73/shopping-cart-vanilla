# Shopping Cart Vanilla

This is a vanilla version of my React practice project, shopping cart. I build
this simple project without React. The styling does not contain Bootstrap either
only vanilla CSS. I fix some design problems with the old project and practice
building web applications only with the main vanilla tools, CSS, HTML and
vanilla JS.
